# P1-Movie-Trailer-Website
This is project one as the part of full stack web developer nanodegree at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd004).
I will write **server-side code** to store a list of my favorite movies, including:
* box art imagery
* movie trailer URL
I will then serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.
